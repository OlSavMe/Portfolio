            I am a web developer with hands-on experience in JavaScript and
            ReactJS development team projects. This includes: creating
            responsive interfaces, configuring API requests, working with
            headless CMS. Through my university studies I have also gained
            knowledge of Node.js, Java, C/C++ and Azure DevOps. In 2020, I will
