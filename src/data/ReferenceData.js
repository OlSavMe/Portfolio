      "When I was interviewing Olga for the developer position, I was very impressed noticing how level headed and professional she is. Olga is very practical with expectations setting and delivers what's promised in due time even if it requires learning new things on the go. She also led sessions at The Shortcut hosted FreeCodeCamp meetup on Redux and did a tremendous job as per feedback from the participants. She is very proficient with JavaScript frontend technologies and especially comfortable with React and necessary libraries to pull off a project from scratch. Olga worked on The Shortcut's database management system's frontend and the new website of The Shortcut both of which required her to use React, and she did a great thorough job on both. I would highly recommend Olga as a great professional, friendly, and welcoming team player and a developer who works very calmly under pressure.",

      " I worked with Olga on the development of the new website for The Shortcut community. Olga proved to be very methodological when faced with unfamiliar technologies, which was very motivating for me. Because of her can-do attitude, I never doubted the success of our project. Olga monitored the team’s GitHub collaboration ensuring timely and verified merges. Aside from Olga’s solid technical skillset, I respect her rational ways of managing disputes and her careful attention to feedback. Being Olga’s teammate, I always knew she had my back. I’d recommend Olga to anyone looking to add to their team of software engineers!",

Olga quickly mastered complicated machinery and mechanics terminology around the Paroc process and construction works. Cooperation has been excellent due to her fascinating character.",
