                When I was interviewing Olga for the developer position, I was
                very impressed noticing how level headed and professional she
                is. Olga is very practical with expectations setting and
                delivers what's promised in due time even if it requires
                learning new things on the go. She also led sessions at The
                Shortcut hosted FreeCodeCamp meetup on Redux and did a
                tremendous job as per feedback from the participants. She is
                very proficient with JavaScript frontend technologies and
                especially comfortable with React and necessary libraries to
                pull off a project from scratch. Olga worked on The Shortcut's
                database management system's frontend and the new website of The
                Shortcut both of which required her to use React, and she did a
                great thorough job on both. I would highly recommend Olga as a
                great professional, friendly, and welcoming team player and a
                developer who works very calmly under pressure.

                I worked with Olga on the development of the new website for The
                Shortcut community. Olga proved to be very methodological when
                faced with unfamiliar technologies, which was very motivating
                for me. Because of her can-do attitude, I never doubted the
                success of our project. Olga monitored the team’s GitHub
                collaboration ensuring timely and verified merges. Aside from
                Olga’s solid technical skillset, I respect her rational ways of
                managing disputes and her careful attention to feedback. Being
                Olga’s teammate, I always knew she had my back. I’d recommend
                Olga to anyone looking to add to their team of software
                engineers!
