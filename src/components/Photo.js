        I am a Web Developer living in Helsinki. I enjoy creating eye-catching
        and user-friendly applications. I have hands-on experience in app
        building using JavaScript, Reac.js (v16.8), React Native, SASS/SCSS,
        JQuery, Bootstrap, REST API, headless CMS, Node.js, Express, Google
        Cloud tools, SQL, CI/CD pipelines and UX prototyping. I've been working
        in multidisciplinary Agile teams within several web development
        projects. In 2020, I am graduating from Haaga Helia UAS as a Software
        Developer. Due to my previous Tech Translatorâ€™s career, I have
        substantial experience of international teamwork.
